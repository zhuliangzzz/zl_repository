# File Name:    create_slot
# File Purpose: This file is called during the ADM process when a slot needs to
#               be peck drilled. It is a c-shell script which is used to calculate
#               a sequence of X/Y co-ordinates which will drill out the slot.

# This file is located in the hooks/ncd directory and forms part of the Auto Drill
# Manager file set. It is a c-shell script which can be used to provide a customised
# routine for peck drilling a slot. This is typically used when the standard routine
# used in a drilling machine canned cycle does not create an acceptable slot (typically
# the canned cycle starts at one end of the slot and works along it).
# This script is started with six parameters passed to it. These parameters can be
# used to calculate the co-ordinates required to drill the slot. These parameters
# are:-
#
# 1. $1 - output filename
# 2. $2 - machine name
# 3. $3 - slot diameter (mils/microns)
# 4. $4 - length (in inches/mm)
# 5. $5 - thickness (mils/microns)
# 6. $6 - layer name 
#
# The output file is read by the ADM program and expects to see a list of X/Y
# co-ordinates. The system assumes that the slot starts at (0,0) and goes to the
# right (horizontal).
# Note: This file is activated by the custom yes/no switch in the machine file and
# NOT by the sw/machine switch in the drill table.
